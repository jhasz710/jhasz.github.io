<h2>The Beginning . . .</h2>
	<p>Maddy and her mom, on a whim took a cake decorating class. Maddy, with her wonderful imagination and background in art, was a natural at decorating. Mom could not decorate, but she could bake. The two created cakes for friends and family. Then, Maddy's future sister-in-law asked the pair if they would make the wedding and groom's cake for their upcoming nuptials. At that wedding, they received inquiries from other couples about creating wedding cakes for their weddings. It was time to open a store. </p>
